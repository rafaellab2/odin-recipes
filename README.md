<p>Before</p>
<p>This is my first project in TOP. 
I will be creating a recipe website using HTML.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to three recipes.
The website will only use HTML since this project is to showcase everything I have learned about HTML so far.</p>
<p>After</p>
<p>During this project I was able to use my new HTML skills to create a recipe webpage which was really fun. 
I also learned more about how to use Git and Github and I overcame some challenges along the way. I know this project isn't perfect but it was a great way to start my journey and I'm glad I did it.</p>
