# odin-recipes
This is my first project in TOP. 
I will be creating a recipe website using HTML.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The website will only use HTML since this project is to showcase everything I have learned about HTML so far.
During this project I was able to use my new HTML skills to create a recipe webpage which was really fun. 
I also learned more about how to use Git and Github and overcome some challenges, when pushing my project, but I overcame them.
