    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li>½ pound sashimi-grade tuna, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot chile sauce</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups prepared sushi rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut off the bottom quarter of each nori sheet; reserve for another use.</li>
        <li>Combine chopped tuna, mayonnaise, green onions, and hot sauce in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Center 1 sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Wet your hands. Spread a thin layer of rice on the nori using your hands; press into a thin layer, leaving a 1/2-inch space at the bottom edge. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Arrange 1/4 of the tuna mixture in a line across the rice, about 1/3 of the way down from the top of the sheet.</li>
        <li>Wet the uncovered edge of the nori. Lift the top end of the mat and firmly roll it over the ingredients. Roll it forward to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Slice the rolls into 3/4-inch pieces using a wet knife. Serve immediately or refrigerate until serving.</li>
    </ol>
